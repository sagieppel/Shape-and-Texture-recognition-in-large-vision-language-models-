## Code related to the paper [Shape and texture recognition in large vision-language models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23062)
1) Code for a) 2D shape extraction from images and b) generation of 2D shapes and textures matching test available from [this url](https://github.com/sagieppel/Automatic-Extraction-Of-Shapes-From-Images-Shape-dataset-generation-)
4) Around 40k samples of the Large Shape and Textures Dataset (LAS&T) are available at [this url](https://icedrive.net/s/CPvz3jZ6hV4WGhQ4v4TA5B3785T5) more images will be a added soon*
2) A sample of 12,000 extracted 2D shapes can be downloaded from [this url.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mb6aYvcwqRGdydCY7AFdvs1zwR8JpOwQ/view?usp=drive_link) more will be a added soon.*

*Note unilimited amount of images can be generated using the generation scription
